# Drug-Types-Prediction-Using-Multinomial-Logistic-Regression
This project develops a multinomial logistic regression model to predict the most appropriate drug for a patient based on the patient information. By leveraging several features, it is expected for the model to identify the type of drug that may be accurate for the patient, optimizing accurate medical decision-making.
